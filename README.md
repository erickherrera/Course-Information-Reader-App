What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    A CSV file contains courses with their ID and the prerequisite courses. After reading the file the lines will be parsed and then stored in a Course object.
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    Binary trees, hash tables and lists are possible data struuctures and for this problem binary tree was the preferred method.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    I reviewed previous assignments that used similar structures and have similar functionalities. 
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    Being able to use binary trees for searching is exapnding my capacity to optimizing search algorithms.
    
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    This project is better at using encapsulation and using recursive strategies to perform searching functions.
